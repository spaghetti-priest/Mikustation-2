# Mikustation 2

Mikustation 2 is a Playstation 2 emulator that aims to aid in Playstation 2 research by emphasising debugging and tools based capabilities. It only supports Windows currnetly with possible future support for mac and linux based machines. It is still in ALPHA stages so this is not to be used recreationally. It intentds to rely on as few dependcies as possible. I have developed this project for personal reasons to learn LLE.

## Current Short-term Roadmap:
- Develop Debugging capabilities (CPU & GPU Registers, BIOS Syscalls, GPU Drawcalls, Stepinto and Drilldown, RAM viewer... etcs)
- Implement JIT compilers into the system
- Implement IOP
- Emulate first commercial game

## Building:
No support for building just yet...

## Current progress:
This emulator can current run a couple of homebrew. However Demo02a is the only one that is completely compatabile right now:
